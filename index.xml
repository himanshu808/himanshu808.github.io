      <description>About As a Research Intern, I was working alongside Anshuman Dhuliya, a PhD student at IIT Bombay, on his project Synergistic Program ANalyzer (SPAN). My role was to contribute to the Front-end of SPAN - to create a source-to-source compiler that takes a high-level specification as input and transpiles it into its Python equivalent.
Problem SPAN required data flow analyses as an input and in Python language to apply those optimizations to an input program.</description>

      <description>Problem Mastek was using an internal help-desk application for their employees to log trouble tickets. This help-desk application was Desktop app and was quite cumbersome and difficult to use. Moreover, in certain situations, such as malfunctioning of keyboard or mouse, it became extremely difficult to raise a ticket. Employees had to log in to their PCs every time to view the ticket status.
Goal To improve the overall user experience of Mastek&amp;rsquo;s internal help-desk application.</description>
