      <description>Responsibilities/Accomplishments After 1.5 years at Visible Alpha, I was promoted to the Software Engineer 2 position. My accomplishments during this time were -
Engineered the framework for adding Snowflake as a data delivery channel using `Falcon`, `Python`, `Snowflake`, `MySQL`, and `AWS S3`, increasing the generated revenue by 45% and reducing the Time To Value Built APIs to reduce the average tech-support turnaround time by 80% from 10 to 2 minutes Revamped the file dispatcher microservice to reduce the number of open SSH connections by 5X using `Paramiko` Implemented a dashboard to report daily file generation and dispatch metrics to aid the Support Team in monitoring failures Performed Snowflake database replication over different regions and clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure) Documented projects using the `Sphinx` documentation generator to improve code maintainability and productivity for new developers Assisted the Infrastructure team with deployment issues I am happy to connect to talk about my work, so reach out to know more!</description>

      <description>Responsibilities/Accomplishments As a Software Engineer in the Data feed and APIs team, I -
Migrated the existing monolithic ETL application to a microservice-based implementation, delivering high-volume, real-time data to clients with low latency, using `Django`, `MongoDB`, and `Redis`, driving $2 million in revenue Optimized file dispatch latency by 80% using `RabbitMQ` &amp; `Celery` for asynchronous task execution (60 to 10 seconds) Designed `REST APIs` and added APIs and `AWS S3` as data delivery channels to ease data consumption for clients Augmented error logging by leveraging the latest features of `Sentry` and by implementing a global logger, saving 25% of the teamâ€™s time spent on debugging and bug fixes Solved complex performance problems by resolving production issues, gaining exposure to dealing with large-scale software design issues, and avoiding performance bottlenecks Worked on projects through different phases of the software development life cycle including writing unit and automation tests and deploying projects on servers using `Docker` and `Jenkins` Wrote unit tests using the `Pytest` framework and increased unit test code coverage from 11% to 77% Carried out load and performance testing of the APIs using `Apache JMeter` to estimate API scalability and identify system lag Improved the Software Engineering process of the team by setting up a dev environment using `Docker` and `Jenkins` for dev testing Assisted the Database Administrator by writing backward-compatible queries for MySQL version migration from MySQL 5.</description>
