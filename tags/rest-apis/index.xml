      <description>Problem Mastek was using an internal help-desk application for their employees to log trouble tickets. This help-desk application was Desktop app and was quite cumbersome and difficult to use. Moreover, in certain situations, such as malfunctioning of keyboard or mouse, it became extremely difficult to raise a ticket. Employees had to log in to their PCs every time to view the ticket status.
Goal To improve the overall user experience of Mastek&amp;rsquo;s internal help-desk application.</description>
