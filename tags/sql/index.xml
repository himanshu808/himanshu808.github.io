Migrated the existing monolithic ETL application to microservices, delivering high-volume, real-time data with low latency to clients, using `Django`, `MongoDB`, and `Redis`, driving `$2 million` in revenue. Reduced the ETL app file dispatch latency by `~80%` using `RabbitMQ` and `Celery` for async task execution (60 to 10 seconds). Added `REST APIs` and `AWS S3` as data delivery channels to ease data consumption for customers.</description>
