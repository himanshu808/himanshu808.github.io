      <description>Responsibilities/Accomplishments After 1.5 years at Visible Alpha, I was promoted to the Software Engineer 2 position. My accomplishments during this time were -
Added Snowflake as a data delivery channel using `Falcon` and `MySQL`, increasing revenue by `45%` and reducing the customerâ€™s Time to Value. Revamped the file dispatcher service to reduce the number of open SSH connections by `5x`, increasing product scalability. Built APIs to reduce the average Tech-Support turnaround time by `80%` from `10` to `2` minutes.</description>
