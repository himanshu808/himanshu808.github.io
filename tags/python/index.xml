      <description>Responsibilities/Accomplishments After 1.5 years at Visible Alpha, I was promoted to the Software Engineer 2 position. My accomplishments during this time were -
Engineered the framework for adding Snowflake as a data delivery channel using `Falcon`, `Python`, `Snowflake`, `MySQL`, and `AWS S3`, increasing the generated revenue by 45% and reducing the Time To Value Built APIs to reduce the average tech-support turnaround time by 80% from 10 to 2 minutes Revamped the file dispatcher microservice to reduce the number of open SSH connections by 5X using `Paramiko` Implemented a dashboard to report daily file generation and dispatch metrics to aid Support Team in monitoring failures Performed Snowflake database replication over different regions and clouds Documented the projects using the `Sphinx` documentation generator Assisted the Infrastructure team with deployment issues I am happy to connect to talk about my work, so reach out to know more!</description>

      <description>Responsibilities/Accomplishments As a Software Engineer in the Data feed and APIs team, I -
Overcame architectural challenges associated with a monolithic design by implementing a microservice-based enterprise fintech ETL application. The solution delivers high-volume, real-time data to clients with low latency, using the latest technologies such as `Django`, `MySQL`, `MongoDB`, and `Redis`, driving $2 million in revenue Optimized file dispatch latency by 80% using `RabbitMQ` &amp; `Celery` for asynchronous task execution (60 to 10 seconds) Designed `REST APIs` and added APIs and `AWS S3` as data delivery channels to ease data consumption for clients Augmented error logging by leveraging the latest features of `Sentry` and by implementing a global logger, saving 25% of the teamâ€™s time spent on debugging and bug fixes Solved complex performance problems by resolving production issues, gaining exposure to dealing with large-scale software design issues, and avoiding performance bottlenecks Worked on projects through different phases of the software development life cycle including writing unit and automation tests and deploying projects on servers using `Docker` and `Jenkins` Wrote unit tests using the `Pytest` framework and increased unit test code coverage from 11% to 77% Carried out load and performance testing of the APIs using `JMeter` Set up a dev environment using Docker and Jenkins for dev testing Wrote backward compatible queries during MySQL version migration Highlights outside the realm of my role Augmented QA team&#39;s automation test suite using `Cucumber` test framework and Behavioral Driven Development (BDD) Set up weekly meetings with the Product team manager to understand the product better and bridge the gap between the product and the dev team I am happy to connect to talk about my work, so reach out to know more!</description>
